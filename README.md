# File_Downloader

This project includes various options like a text box, an input box, select options, and a save button. Upon entering text into the text box, selecting the file format, and clicking the "save" button, a new file will be created on your computer with the entered text. The file name is optional, and if left blank, the file will be automatically saved with a unique name.
