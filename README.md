# File_Downloader

This project includes various options like a text box, an input box, select options, and a save button. Upon entering text into the text box, selecting the file format, and clicking the "save" button, a new file will be created on your computer with the entered text. The file name is optional, and if left blank, the file will be automatically saved with a unique name.

You can download the files in various formats like html, css, text, doc, ppt, svg, zip and json format. This is done through with the help of MIME which stands for Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions. MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) is an enhanced version of the Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) email protocol, which enables users to share a wide range of data files via email, such as audio, video, images, and application programs.
